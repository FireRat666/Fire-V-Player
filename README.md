# Fire-V-Player

A collaborative, embeddable YouTube video player designed for virtual worlds inside Banter VR. It allows users to create shared playlists, vote on songs, and watch together in a synchronized real-time environment.

It features a persistent state using a PostgreSQL database, making it suitable for platforms like Render where instances may sleep and restart.

## Features

-   **Two Distinct Modes:** Choose between a collaborative **Playlist Mode** or a turn-based **Karaoke Mode**.
-   **Real-time Sync:** High-precision synchronization of video playback using playback rate adjustments for smooth, sub-second corrections.
-   **Persistent State:** Shared playlists and player settings are saved to a database, surviving server restarts.
-   **Robust Host Controls:** A host can lock the playlist, reorder songs, skip, and manage permissions.
-   **Flexible Permissions:** Features a "Take Over" mode for hostless rooms and a democratic voting system for song selection.
-   **Rich Content:** Easily search YouTube or import entire playlists.
-   **VR-Ready:** Designed for 3D environments with features like spatial audio, in-world UI, and hand controls.
-   **Automated Maintenance:** Stale, inactive instances are automatically purged from the database to keep it lean.
